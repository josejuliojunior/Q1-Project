# Q1-Project: Trail Finder

## About

My project came from a need of my own.
As every mountain biking practitioner, I like to be always practicing the sport and exploring new places.
When I'm traveling in a place I don't know it's hard to find trails to do.
From this need, I developed a site where you only have to enter a city in the US that it will list all the mountain bike trails and show them in Google maps.
After searching the user has the possibility to choose a trail and see information about it, such as size, description, direction and a photo of the place.
Another feature is that the user is able to choose the types of the map he wants to see, such as Roadmap, Satellite, Hybrid, Terrain.
